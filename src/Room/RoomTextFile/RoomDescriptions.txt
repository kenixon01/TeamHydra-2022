The foyer is grand from what you can see, from the little light that comes through the closed drapes.
Several credenzas and numerous paintings of unknown pompous individuals line the room, assembled high to the 30-foot
tall ceiling. Dust swirls around in abundance. The air is stale and reeks of death and agony.
----
This room is a lounge with intact but ripped up furniture with a few photos of the family who previously lived there.
You see some burned up books, but otherwise it is a cold damp room.
----
A heavy scent of sage and jasmine pierced your nose as you opened the door.
Lit by a few bulbs, this room is heavily forested with mysterious herbs that you have never even seen before.
----
This room is untouched. There is a big chandelier in the middle of the room and a red velvet bench underneath it.
3 paintings were spread out in the 3 corners of the room. Painting 1 is a portrait of Doctor Honthin in his lab coat.
Painting 2 is an imagery of the Two Gods; Anemis, God of the Sun, and Aaldir, God of the Moon, and a Latin script
underneath that says “Luce et Tenebris” Painting 3 is a portrait of Doctor Honthin’s late father, Alfred Honthin Sr,
a wealthy surgeon and devout follower of the Children of the Two Gods.
----
Prayer beads, mysterious bottles, religious ornaments, varieties of incense, and sacred scrolls fill the room.
The Bible of the Two Gods is left open on the table.
----
The room is dark with a few candles lit in all 4 corners of the room.
There is two black and white banners behind the black altar that reads “Luce et Tenebris”.
----
This room is luckily an organized room with minimum furniture, but it is covered in an extreme amount of dust.
----
The room has random splatters of black and white paint everywhere and has a weird smell of rotten meat.
----
This room was for storing cleaning utensils for maintaining the mansion, but now it belongs to Lady Swan.
----
This room has ripped-up walls and creaky floorboards. A very dark scary room with a smell of death in the air.
----
You enter the room and see lanterns, armor stands, and wall mounts surrounding the perimeter of the room.
Although they are mostly empty, you might be able to find something useful here.
----
Open chests line up the walls of the room with various heirlooms on display.
You continue to scan the room and see various corpses on the floor with arrows protruding from them.
You see a hooded figure in the corner readying his bow.
----
Music stands with musical manuscripts stock the room. You see several percussion instruments laying about.
You’d like to play something to lighten up the mood, but you remember you have no musical talent.
----
The walls appear to have writing on them in blood, “495” you read.
A desk sitting in the center of the room is illuminated by the faint beams that come out of the barred window.
----
Doctor Honthin’s bedroom. Dimly lit, gloomy, dark, and somber. All four walls are covered by bookshelves.
A huge bronze safe is located next to his bed. Sacred scrolls are all scattered as far as the eyes could see.
----
As you enter, you notice wine racks surround the room. The vast quantity of alcohol seems enticing.
You shudder at the thought of the price, your life probably pales in comparison.
----
You enter what appears to be the library. Reading chairs dot the floor and bookshelves line the walls.
Not one thing seems out of place here, this might be the most well-kept room in the entire building
----
The bathroom is in disarray. The shower curtain is limply hanging off the rod, torn and bloodstained.
The white floor tile is only just visible through the gore that squishes beneath your feet as you enter.
----
The drapes are closed, casting the large circular room in a gloomy ambience. Couches and chairs appear
to be smashed and strewn about, as if a Behemoth- the ones with thumbs - stepped on a particularly sharp rock.
----
After finally forming the key to unlock the Basement, you open the door to what seems to be a
medical laboratory, dimly lit only by a steam powered light bulb haphazardly hanging from the ceiling.
----
At the beginning of this hallway you see two doors to your left and right, and more of the hallway ahead of you?
----
At the end of this hallway you see two rooms to your left and right which way do you wish to go?
