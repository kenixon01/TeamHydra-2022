A member of the Order of the Broken Heart. Artemis was raised as a child by powerful Dark Elves.Having been exposed
to their archery since birth, he joined their highest ranks off skill alone. While he doesn't have any of their
abilities, he is a dangerous ranger. He’d be a famous archer if he didn’t stick to the shadows, a trait he picked up
from his upbringing.
